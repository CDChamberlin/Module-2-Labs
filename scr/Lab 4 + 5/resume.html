        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          With over four years of work experience in various roles, I am a
          versatile and adaptable professional with a passion for data analysis
          and bookkeeping. I have a bachelor's degree in general mathematics and
          certifications in R and SPSS, which enable me to handle high-variety
          and high-volume data with ease and accuracy. I am currently seeking a
          new opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a dynamic and
          innovative organization that values curiosity, collaboration, and
          continuous learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my most recent role as a Junior Bookkeeper at Bottomline Books,
          LLC, I performed daily and monthly accounting tasks using QuickBooks
          Desktop. I reconciled bank and credit card accounts, entered and paid
          invoices, posted payments and receipts, and ran payroll. I
          demonstrated my attention to detail, organizational skills, and
          problem-solving abilities in this role, as well as my proficiency in
          typing and data entry.
