        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p>With over four years of work experience in various roles, I am a versatile and adaptable professional with a passion for data analysis and bookkeeping. I have a bachelor's degree in general mathematics and certifications in R and SPSS, which enable me to handle high-variety and high-volume data with ease and accuracy. I am currently seeking a new opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a dynamic and innovative organization that values curiosity, collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>
        <p>In my most recent role as a Junior Bookkeeper at Bottomline Books, LLC, I performed daily and monthly accounting tasks using QuickBooks Desktop. I reconciled bank and credit card accounts, entered and paid invoices, posted payments and receipts, and ran payroll. I demonstrated my attention to detail, organizational skills, and problem-solving abilities in this role, as well as my proficiency in typing and data entry.</p>
